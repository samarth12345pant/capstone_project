# Find Location to Build New Cinema in Hong Kong

## Introduction:

"Would you recommend a location in Hong Kong to open a new cinema?"
My friend, the stakeholder wants to open a new cinema as company's new business.

He explains that watching movie is a part of whole afternoon or night activities.
Cinema should have many restaurants and shopping places nearby. Transportation is also an important factor. 
Customer can walk to cinema within 10 minutes from public transport facilities is perfect.

He wants me concentrated on selection of cinema location according to its nearby environment.
Cinema facility and rental price is not my concern. 
He lists out his top 10 favourite cinemas in Hong Kong with rating.

I worked and selected 5 possible locations to build the cinema. Which location should be suggested to my friend?
